1. âœ” Eliminate props() interface.
Instead use a mapping function in the HOC. This is more familiar since redux / apollo / mobx all do it that way.
This requires exposing the necessary interface at the root controller level, which is also more natural.

2. Eliminate property injected state / setState.
I should not *need* to use a container to construct the controller. It feels unnatural and confusing.
Instead allow controllers to maintain their own state and somehow notify the HOC that
changes need to be propagated.
